            <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
            <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It's a quick way to assess whether you're within a healthy weight range.</p>

            <h2>BMI Categories</h2>
            <p><strong>Underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5):</strong></p>
            <p>If your BMI is below 18.5, it means you're underweight. This could be a sign that you are not getting enough nutrients to support healthy body function. Being underweight can lead to issues such as weakened immunity, fragile bones, and nutrient deficiencies. It's important to consult a healthcare provider to develop a healthy eating plan.</p>

            <p><strong>Normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9):</strong></p>
            <p>A BMI in this range indicates that you have a healthy weight for your height. Maintaining a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It’s important to continue eating a balanced diet and getting regular physical activity to stay in this range.</p>

            <p><strong>Overweight (BMI 25–29.9):</strong></p>
            <p>A BMI between 25 and 29.9 indicates that you are overweight. While not necessarily dangerous on its own, being overweight can increase the risk of developing health conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. Regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you manage your weight.</p>

            <p><strong>Obesity (BMI 30 or higher):</strong></p>
            <p>A BMI of 30 or higher means that you are in the obesity category. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of serious health problems, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. It’s important to seek medical advice to create a weight management plan that includes healthy eating, exercise, and possibly other interventions.</p>
